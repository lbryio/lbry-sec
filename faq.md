## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a civil case against LBRY Inc. alleging that all distributions of LBRY Credits by LBRY Inc. are unregistered securities offerings. This claim is both devoid of fact and a tremendous threat to the entire cryptocurrency industry.

The LBRY network is decentralized and not at risk. For LBRY customers, your channels, content, and token holdings are not at risk. Even in an unlikely scenario in which LBRY Inc. loses, the LBRY protocol and work on it will continue.

LBRY Inc. has been preparing to fight this case for three full years, which is how long the SEC has been investigating this matter. We wanted to tell you sooner, but transparency in ongoing investigations is not welcomed by the SEC.
